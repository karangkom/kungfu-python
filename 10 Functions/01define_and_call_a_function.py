"""
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters,
into a function. A function can return data as a result. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a
high degree of code reusing. As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but
you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.
"""


def main():
    print('Hello, this is create by function')


main()
""" 
notes:
- to create a function, use the def keyword e.g. def main()
- to call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis e.g. main()
